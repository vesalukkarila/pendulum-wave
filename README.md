# Pendulum wave

The goal of this project is to create a virtual representation of pendulum wave using Javascript P5.js library. This will function as platform to try out different compositions and color schemes for the physical pendulum wave, which will be built during january-february 2025, for the summer -25 MitäsMitäsMitäs-festival.  
Test phase of the physical one can be seen at: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iBPbeaAqGlA&t
